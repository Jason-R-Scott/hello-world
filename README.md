# hello-world



Hello GitHub!

I am a new developer currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp Coding Dojo Chicago. So far I have completed Web Fundamentals, and the Python stack using some Flask and mostly Django. 

Currently I am learning and working with C# and about to delve into .NET Core and ASP.NET. After C#, my cohort will be moving on to the MEAN stack for another 4 weeks. My goal is to be working as a developer in Chicago as soon as possible after graduation. There are many great companies in Chicago and I am excited to begin the process!

Thanks for reading!
